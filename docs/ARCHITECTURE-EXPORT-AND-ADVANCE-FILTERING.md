# Architecture Overview: Task Export and Advanced Filtering System

This document outlines the architectural decisions and implementation approach for the "Task Export and Advanced Filtering System" feature, as per the requirements of the WSD Full-Stack JavaScript Technical Test.

## 1. Feature Overview

The primary goal is to extend the existing Task Analytics Dashboard with robust capabilities for exporting task data and applying advanced filtering criteria. This feature aims to provide users with:
- The ability to export filtered task data in multiple formats (CSV, JSON).
- A comprehensive history of all performed exports for auditing.
- Real-time feedback on export progress and completion.
- Optimized performance through caching mechanisms.

This system leverages the existing full-stack architecture, including Node.js (Express.js), MongoDB (Mongoose), Redis, and Socket.IO for the backend, and Vue.js 3 (Vuetify 3, Pinia) for the frontend.

## 2. Architectural Decisions

Our approach prioritizes integration with the existing codebase, adherence to established patterns, performance, and a user-friendly experience.

### 2.1 Backend API Development

#### 2.1.1 Enhanced Task Filtering

**Decision:** The existing task API (`backend/src/routes/api.js`) has been extended to support a comprehensive set of filtering parameters. This is achieved by utilizing the `queryBuilderService.js` to dynamically construct MongoDB queries based on these criteria.

**Justification:**
- **Consistency:** Reuses the existing `queryBuilderService` which is already responsible for constructing queries, maintaining a single source of truth for query logic.
- **Flexibility:** Allows for combining multiple filter criteria, providing powerful data segmentation for users.
- **Efficiency:** Centralizing query building helps optimize database interactions.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Date-based filtering:** Filters include `createdAfter`, `createdBefore`, `completedAfter`, `completedBefore`, `updatedAfter`, `updatedBefore`, and predefined ranges like `createdWithin` and `completedWithin` (e.g., `last-7-days`, `last-30-days`, `last-90-days`).
- **Time-based filtering:** Filters for `estimatedTimeMin`, `estimatedTimeMax`, `actualTimeMin`, `actualTimeMax`, and `noEstimate` (tasks without estimated time).
- **Advanced Status-based filtering:** Includes `overdueTasks` (in-progress for more than 7 days) and `recentlyCompleted` (completed within the last 7 days).
- **Performance-based filtering:** Filters for `underEstimated` (actual time > estimated time) and `overEstimated` (actual time < estimated time).
- **Combined criteria:** The `queryBuilderService` handles logical `AND` operations for combining multiple filter parameters.

#### 2.1.2 MongoDB Indexing for Performance

**Decision:** New indexes have been added to the `Task` model (`backend/src/models/Task.js`) to optimize query performance for the newly introduced advanced filters.

**Justification:**
- **Query Optimization:** Indexes significantly speed up queries on frequently filtered fields, especially for date ranges and status-based lookups.
- **Scalability:** Improves performance as the dataset grows.

**Implementation Details:**
- Indexes added on `completedAt`, `updatedAt`, `estimatedTime`, `actualTime`, `status` with `createdAt`, and `status` with `completedAt`.

#### 2.1.3 Export API Design

**Decision:** A dedicated API endpoint for initiating exports, `POST /api/export/tasks`, has been implemented. This endpoint accepts filtering parameters and the desired export format (CSV/JSON). Additionally, `GET /api/exports` provides access to export history, and `GET /exports/download/:filename` allows direct download of completed exports.

**Justification:**
- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Distinguishes export operations from standard CRUD operations.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Exporting potentially large datasets is handled asynchronously, preventing timeouts and improving responsiveness.
- **Format Flexibility:** The API supports both CSV and JSON formats.
- **Direct Download:** Provides a dedicated endpoint for retrieving generated files.

**Implementation Details:**
- The `POST /api/export/tasks` endpoint triggers an asynchronous export process via the `asyncExportService.js`.
- The response immediately returns a `jobId` and status, indicating that the export has been queued.
- The `exportService.js` encapsulates the logic for generating CSV/JSON data from filtered tasks.

#### 2.1.4 Export Tracking

**Decision:** A new MongoDB model, `ExportHistory`, has been introduced to store metadata about each export request. This model tracks the `exportId`, `userId`, `timestamp`, `status` (e.g., `pending`, `processing`, `completed`, `failed`), `format`, `filterCriteria`, `queryParameters`, `cacheKey`, and the `filePath` of the generated export file.

**Justification:**
- **Auditing & User Reference:** Provides a clear record of all exports, fulfilling the business requirement for tracking history.
- **Persistence:** MongoDB is suitable for storing this structured metadata.
- **Real-time Feedback:** The `status` field is crucial for providing real-time updates to the frontend.
- **Caching Integration:** The `cacheKey` field links export history records to cached results.

**Implementation Details:**
- API endpoints (`GET /api/exports`, `GET /api/exports/:id`) allow users to view their export history and retrieve details of specific exports.
- The `ExportHistory` model includes methods for `createExportRecord`, `markProcessing`, `markCompleted`, and `markFailed` to manage the lifecycle of an export.

#### 2.1.5 Performance Optimization (2-Level Caching)

**Decision:** A 2-level caching strategy is implemented for export results, utilizing Redis (Level 1) for fast metadata lookup and the `ExportHistory` MongoDB collection (Level 2) for persistent storage of completed export records. Additionally, Redis is used for caching analytics metrics and individual task data.

**Justification:**
- **Reduced Server Load:** Prevents regeneration of identical exports and analytics data, significantly reducing database queries and processing time.
- **Improved User Experience:** Faster retrieval of previously generated exports and quicker loading of analytics.
- **Redis Suitability:** Redis is an in-memory data store ideal for fast caching and temporary storage.
- **Database Persistence:** The `ExportHistory` collection provides a reliable, persistent record of all exports, even if Redis cache is cleared.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Cache Key Generation:** Unique cache keys are generated based on a hash of the export's filter criteria and format, ensuring consistency. The `getDataFreshnessTimestamp` method in `exportCacheService.js` ensures cache invalidation when underlying data changes.
- **Cache Invalidation:** Cache entries have a time-to-live (TTL). For export data, the cache is also invalidated if underlying task data changes (e.g., a task is updated, deleted, or created that matches cached filter criteria). Analytics caches are invalidated on relevant data changes.
- **2-Level Cache Flow:** When an export is requested, the system first checks Redis (Level 1). If not found, it checks the `ExportHistory` collection (Level 2). If a valid record is found in Level 2, it's used to populate Level 1 for future faster access.

#### 2.1.6 Asynchronous Export Processing (Simple Queue)

**Decision:** A simple in-memory job queue is used to process export requests asynchronously, preventing long-running operations from blocking the main API thread.

**Justification:**
- **Improved Responsiveness:** The API can immediately respond to export requests, providing a better user experience.
- **Resource Management:** Long-running export tasks are offloaded to a background process, preventing server overload.

**Implementation Details:**
- The `asyncExportService.js` manages an in-memory `jobQueue`.
- When an export request is received, it's added to this queue.
- A separate `processJobs` function picks up jobs from the queue and processes them sequentially.
- Real-time updates via Socket.IO inform the client about the job's progress and completion.

#### 2.1.7 Real-time Features

**Decision:** The existing Socket.IO infrastructure is leveraged to provide real-time updates on export progress and completion.

**Justification:**
- **Existing Infrastructure:** Reuses the established WebSocket connection, minimizing new dependencies and integration effort.
- **Immediate Feedback:** Users receive instant notifications about the status of their exports, enhancing the user experience for long-running operations.

**Implementation Details:**
- The backend emits Socket.IO events (e.g., `export-update` with `started`, `completed`, `failed` statuses) to the client, including the `exportId` and current status/progress.
- These events are triggered by the `asyncExportService` as it processes the export jobs.

### 2.2 Frontend User Interface

#### 2.2.1 Advanced Filtering Interface

**Decision:** Advanced filtering options are integrated directly into the existing task list view, utilizing Vuetify components for a consistent UI.

**Justification:**
- **User Flow:** Keeps filtering contextual to the task list, where users are already viewing and managing tasks.
- **Vuetify Components:** Leverages existing Vuetify components for a consistent look and feel (e.g., `v-select`, `v-switch`, `v-text-field`, `v-chip`).

**Implementation Details:**
- A clear "Filters" card with an expand/collapse button (`mdi-chevron-up`/`mdi-chevron-down`) toggles the visibility of additional filtering options.
- Active filters are displayed prominently as `v-chip` components, allowing users to easily see and remove applied filters.
- Filter state is managed within the `taskStore.js` (Pinia) to ensure consistency across components and persistence during navigation.

#### 2.2.2 Export User Interface

**Decision:** An "Export" button with a dropdown menu for format selection (CSV/JSON) is added to the task list toolbar. Clicking this initiates an asynchronous export.

**Justification:**
- **Accessibility:** Placing the export functionality near the task list makes it easily discoverable.
- **Guided Process:** The dropdown provides a clear way to select the export format.
- **Asynchronous Feedback:** The UI immediately indicates that an export job has been created and relies on real-time notifications for completion.

**Implementation Details:**
- The `exportTasks` action in `taskStore.js` handles the API call to initiate the export.
- Upon successful job creation, a message is displayed to the user, indicating that the export is in progress and they will be notified upon completion.
- Completed exports trigger an automatic download via the `downloadExportFile` utility.

#### 2.2.3 Export History Management

**Decision:** A new dedicated view/page (`/export-history`) is created, accessible from the main navigation. This page displays a paginated table of past exports.

**Justification:**
- **Clear Overview:** A dedicated page provides ample space to display detailed export history.
- **Auditing:** Allows users to easily review past exports, their status, and download links.
- **Scalability:** Handles a growing list of exports without cluttering other views.

**Implementation Details:**
- The page fetches export history from the backend API (`GET /api/exports`).
- Each entry shows `filename`, `status`, `query parameters` (with tooltip for details), `total records`, `file size`, `duration`, `created at`, `error message`, and a `download` button for completed exports.
- Real-time updates refresh the status of pending exports on this page.
- Overall export statistics (total, completed, failed, pending) are displayed on this page.

#### 2.2.4 Dashboard Integration

**Decision:** Export-related metrics are integrated into the existing analytics dashboard as new `MetricCard` components.

**Justification:**
- **Holistic View:** Provides a complete picture of task-related activities, including exports.
- **Leverage Existing Components:** Reuses `MetricCard` for consistent display of key metrics (e.g., "Total Exports", "Completed Exports", "Failed Exports", "Last Export").

**Implementation Details:**
- The `analyticsService.js` (backend) has been extended to provide export-related metrics.
- The `analyticsStore.js` (frontend) fetches and manages this data, displaying it on the dashboard.

#### 2.2.5 Real-time User Experience

**Decision:** Toast notifications (via `v-snackbar` or a custom notification system) are implemented for export progress and completion, and automatic download of completed exports.

**Justification:**
- **Non-intrusive Feedback:** Notifications provide updates without interrupting the user's workflow.
- **Immediate Awareness:** Users are instantly aware of changes in export status.
- **Convenience:** Automatic download streamlines the user experience for completed exports.

**Implementation Details:**
- Socket.IO events from the backend (`export-update`) trigger these notifications.
- Notifications include clear messages (e.g., "Export started...", "Export completed successfully!", "Export failed: [error message]").
- Upon `completed` status, the `downloadExportFile` utility is called to automatically download the generated file.
- Connection issues are handled gracefully by displaying warning messages and attempting to reconnect.

## 3. Quality & Testing Strategy

### 3.1 Error Handling & Edge Cases

**Decision:** Comprehensive error handling is implemented at both backend and frontend.

**Justification:**
- **Robustness:** Ensures the system remains stable even when unexpected issues occur.
- **User Experience:** Provides clear and actionable feedback to users when errors happen.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Backend:** Uses `try-catch` blocks in services and controllers. Leverages the existing `errorHandler.js` middleware for consistent error responses. Handles cases like invalid filter parameters, database errors, file write failures, and large dataset processing issues. Export failures are recorded in `ExportHistory`.
- **Frontend:** Displays user-friendly error messages in notifications. Implements retry mechanisms for transient network issues. Auto-download failures are also notified.

### 3.2 Testing Strategy

**Decision:** A multi-layered testing strategy was envisioned, but due to time constraints, the current implementation focuses on critical unit tests and logic-level verification, with broader integration and end-to-end tests largely omitted.

**Justification:**
- **Focused Coverage:** Prioritized testing of core logic and data models to ensure fundamental correctness within the given time.
- **Pragmatic Approach:** Acknowledged time limitations by deferring more complex and time-consuming integration/end-to-end tests.

**Implementation Details:**
- Due to time constraints, only basic unit tests were implemented to provide a foundational understanding of the core logic and functionality. Comprehensive integration and end-to-end tests were omitted.

### 3.3 Performance & Scalability

**Decision:** Focus on optimizing database queries, leveraging Redis caching, and asynchronous processing for large exports.

**Justification:**
- **Responsiveness:** Ensures the application remains performant even with growing data.
- **Resource Efficiency:** Minimizes server load and database strain.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Database Queries:** Appropriate indexing on MongoDB collections for frequently filtered fields (e.g., `createdAt`, `status`, `priority`, `completedAt`, `updatedAt`, `estimatedTime`, `actualTime`, `cacheKey`).
- **Asynchronous Exports:** The backend export process runs in the background via the job queue, freeing up the main request thread.
- **Batch Processing:** The streaming approach for CSV and JSON exports handles large datasets efficiently without loading everything into memory.
- **2-Level Caching:** Reduces redundant export generation and speeds up retrieval of frequently requested data.

## 4. Opportunities for Future Enhancements

- **Scheduled Exports:** Allow users to schedule recurring exports (e.g., daily, weekly reports).
- **Export Templates:** Enable users to save frequently used filter combinations as export templates.
- **Cloud Storage Integration:** Option to upload and serve exported files directly to cloud storage services(e.g., S3, Google Cloud Storage).
- **Advanced Analytics Integration:** Deeper integration with the analytics system to provide insights into export usage patterns.
- **Export Previews:** Provide a small preview of the data before initiating a full export.
- **More Export Formats:** Support additional formats like PDF or Excel.
- **Webhooks/Notifications:** Configure webhooks or email notifications upon export completion.
- **Robust Job Queue:** Migrate from simple in-memory queue to a more robust, persistent queue system (e.g., Redis Queue, RabbitMQ) for better fault tolerance and scalability in production environments.
